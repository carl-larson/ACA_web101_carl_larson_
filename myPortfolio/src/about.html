                    <p>Let me tell you the history of men growing hair on their upper lips. It is quite a lot of interesting hair trends over the millenia that men shaved their cheeks and necks but not the top flap of their food funnels. Indubitably, one can not dubit that the mustache is a grand attention-getter in the world stage of haircraft and masculine face shapes.</p>
                    <p>The honor of a family resides in the length of one's nose bush. Those who grow all the face hair in a beard are disqualified from honor and discounted comb service. Those with no face hair at all are likewise bystanders to the grand parade.</p>
                    <p>Thus it is written as it always has been and forever will be for our grandchildren's grandchildren's elite society of whistle washers.</p>
